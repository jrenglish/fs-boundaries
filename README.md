# Forest Service Boundaries

This repository contains boundary data developed by the US Forest Service for National Forests and Grasslands. It is **not** the official source for any of the data it contains. You should visit the [FS Geodata Clearinghouse](http://fsgeodata.fs.fed.us/vector/lsrs.php) to browse and download official vector and raster datasets for the US Forest Service.

###Shouldn't there be just one boundary? 
Well, it's complicated. There are administrative boundaries and proclaimed boundaries. The proclaimed boundaries are what defined each National Forest when they were established by Congress. Over time, many forests have combined operations, merging two or more forests into one. Since they share administration, their administrative boundary consists of all the proclaimed boundaries of the forests that were merged. On the ground, though, many forests are still referred to by their proclaimed names. In addition, National Grasslands are, with few exceptions, mangaged by the closest National Forest. This causes the Grassland to be contained within the managing National Forests's administrative boundary, even though, on the ground and on maps, Grasslands are frequently seen as separate units. Complicated.
